# SentiGauge
This project focuses on sentiment analysis using traditional machine learning models, applied to a reviews dataset. It addresses class imbalance, optimizes models with GridSearchCV, and converts text data into numerical features using TF-IDF vectorization for accurate classification into positive and negative sentiments.
